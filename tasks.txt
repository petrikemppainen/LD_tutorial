##### start with simulated data
1. look at file "Simulate_data.R", what are the default settings for simulated data?
2. Run all script ("set up" only needs to be done once), which produces four figures. What are these figures?
3. Run the last line that plots an LD network by changing the "threshold", what does this do?

## sample size, NE and recombination rate
Below we will look at how different settings change the LD patterns in the data. 
 - For each change, try first to predict what you expect to see from the four figures.
 - Did you get expected results?? Why not?
 
4. What happens when sample size is lowered (try 1000, 100, 50, 20). Why?
5. What happens when Ne is lowered (try 1000, 100, 50, 20). Why?
6. What happens when r is increased. Why?
7. How do Ne and r depend on each other?


## population structure
8. What happens when m > 0 and why? m is migration rate between two populations (try m between 0.1 and 10)

## admixture
"admixture_nGen" is the number o generations of admixture between populations that have been separated (m=0) for "div_time" generations
9. What happens when "admixture_nGen" is 0,1,2,10,100 ?. Pay close attention to the LD network graphs, and try with different thresholds! How do you explain the patterns?

 
## implications for GWAS and QTL mapping
10. If you were to do GWAS on the simulated data above, how do you expect the different parameters to affect your analyses?


################# GWAS/QTL #####################
 - Use the below parameters to simulate data. This simulates a human genome.

parameters <- list(
  folder = "LD_sim", 
  Ne = 2000, 
  r = 0.0001, 
  sampleSize = 500,
  chrom_sizes = human, # chromosome number and size distribution as in the human genome
  maf = 0.05, 
  subsample = TRUE, 
  nLoci = 500,
  m = NA,
  admixture_nGen = NA, 
  LD = TRUE,
  div_time = 5000
)

## mutation rates and recombination rates are adjusted to get enough segregating loci and recombination rate is 10 times the mutation rate
parameters$u <- ((4*parameters$nLoci/(2*parameters$Ne))/sum(1/(1:(parameters$sampleSize))))/sum(parameters$chrom_sizes)
parameters$r <- parameters$u*10

sim_data <- get_LD_sim_data(parameters)

 - now run code in "GWAS.R"
 

11. You started with 5 causal loci with h2=0.5. The P-value is P1df. Does the GWAS find all causal loci?. What is an easy way to correct for multiple testing? Do you find any other significant loci in addition to the causal loci?

12. What are the observed and expected P-value distributions. What is the expectation for the P-value distribution when there are no causal loci? You can test this by setting h2=0 and repeating the analyses (starting from simulation of phenotypes) 

13. Is there any P-value inflation?

14. How do your results change if you use "parameters$r <- parameters$u" instead for the simulated data?

15. How about if you use "m <- 2" (again use r = 10*u)?

17. In what two ways can you correct for P-value inflation?

### QTL ###
18. Now repeat the analyses above, but you want to simulate a data set that mimics an F2 intercross. How would you do that? 
19. Once you have managed 18, how do the results differ from above?

20. So what is the actual difference between GWAS and QTL mapping?
